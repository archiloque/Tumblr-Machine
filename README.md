# Tumblr Machine

A Tumblr feedreader and reblogging tool written in ruby.

Setup a list of interesting tags with a score and it will pull new posts from the tags and display the ones with the highest score, and you'll be able to reblog the one you likes with a single click.

Can process the linked images to eliminates duplicates (see bellow).

Code should be easy to hack on, contact me for any question.

I'm using an {ssl client certificate}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Client-authenticated_TLS_handshake]
for authentication which requires some configuration on the frontal nginx / apache.

# Instructions

- deploy the application on your server
- register a tumblr application at http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps and get the OAuth consumer key and secret key, for the callback url use http://your_webiste/callback
- set the environment variables (see bellow)
- connect to the server (the database structure will be created automatically) and setup the tags
- schedule an http call to /fetch_next_tags_external to retrieve the latest posts for the tags
